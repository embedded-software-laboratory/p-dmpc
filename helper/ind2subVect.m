function X = ind2subVect(siz,ndx)
%IND2SUBVECT Multiple subscripts from linear index.
%   IND2SUBVECT is used to determine the equivalent subscript values
%   corresponding to a given single index into an array.
%
%   X = IND2SUBVECT(SIZ,IND) returns the matrix X = [I J] containing the
%   equivalent row and column subscripts corresponding to the index
%   matrix IND for a matrix of size SIZ.  
%
%   For N-D arrays, X = IND2SUBVECT(SIZ,IND) returns matrix X = [I J K ...]
%   containing the equivalent N-D array subscripts equivalent to IND for 
%   an array of size SIZ.

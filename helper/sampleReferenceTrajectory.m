% Computes equidistant points along a piecewise linear curve. The first
% point is the point on the curve closest to the given point
% (vehicle_x,vehicle_y). All following points are on the curve with a
% distance of 'stepSize' to their predecessor.

% Arguments: 
%       nSamples: number of points created
%       referenceTrajectory: piecewise linear curve [x1 y1; x2 y2; ...]
%       vehicle_x,vehicle_y: start point
%       stepSize: Distance between points [d1; d2; ...]
% Returns: points [x1 y1; x2 y2; ...]

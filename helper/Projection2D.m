% PROJECTION2D  Takes a line and a point, determines the projection (point with shortest distance), distance and
%               'parameter' of the projection.
% Params:
%      x1,y1,x2,y2: Points that make a line.
%      x3,y3:       The point to be projected.
% Returns:
%      xp,yp:       The projected point.
%      projection_distance: Signed distance of (xp,yp) and (x3,y3)
%      lambda:      The line 'parameter'. Is zero if (x1,y1)==(xp,yp)
%                   and one if (x2,y2)==(xp,yp).
%      line_segment_len: Distance between (x1,y1) and (x2,y2)

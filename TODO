- Clean ExperimentResult from data that is already in ControlResultsInfo (edit JK: EvaluationParl uses these variables; fix?)
- Make sure Cpp optimizers work as expected
- Fix export_video, needs to send x0 and current time
  - x0 from MPA
  - create MPA from options in `export_video`
  - set `options.tick_per_step` according to framerate
  - Use functionality in `path_between()` to find x0 for frames (move function to `export_video`)

# Receding Horizon Graph Search
This repository contains the source code for Receding Horizon Graph Search (RHGS), a MATLAB implementation of a graph-based receding horizon trajectory planner.

The code is developed with MATLAB R2021a.
To run a simulation:
1. execute `startup.m`
2. execute `main.m`.

More information is provided in our publication [1], which we kindly ask you to consider citing if you find RHGS helpful for your work.

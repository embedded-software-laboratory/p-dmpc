# Receding Horizon Graph Search
This repository contains the source code for Receding Horizon Graph Search (RHGS), a MATLAB implementation of a graph-based receding horizon trajectory planner.

The code is developed with MATLAB R2021a.
To run a simulation:
```matlab
startup()
main()
```

More information is provided in our publication [1], which we kindly ask you to consider citing if you find RHGS helpful for your work.
The results of the publication can be reproduced by running
```matlab
startup()
eval_paper()
```
This will take a while. The results are then found in the folder "results".
